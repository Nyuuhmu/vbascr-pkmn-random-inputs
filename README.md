# Bias Mode
As running around aimlessly doesnt really work most of the time (looking at you, one-way ledges), you have the option to give the script some sense of direction. With this mode youre able to set a direction bias which increases the chance to walk into the direction of choice, and decreases the chance to walk in the direction exactly opposite.
- W: Bias Up
- A: Bias Left
- S: Bias Down
- D: Bias Right
- Q/E/R: Reset Bias
